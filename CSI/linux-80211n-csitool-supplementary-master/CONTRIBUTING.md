# How to get help using the CSI Tool

Before asking us a question, you MUST:

1. Verify that your issue is not represented in the existing list of [frequently asked questions (FAQ)](http://dhalperi.github.io/linux-80211n-csitool/faq.html).
2. Double-check that you carefully followed the [installation instructions](http://dhalperi.github.io/linux-80211n-csitool/installation.html). We can only offer assistance with installation or collecting CSI if you are using a version of Ubuntu Linux that has [not reached end-of-life](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases).
3. Search [existing GitHub issues](https://github.com/dhalperi/linux-80211n-csitool-supplementary/issues?q=) to see if your question has previously been asked and/or answered.

If none of these provide you with any leads, then please [create a **new** issue](https://github.com/dhalperi/linux-80211n-csitool-supplementary/issues/new).

Thank you!
